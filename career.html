            This whole CSS stuff is very new to me, though I wanted to try it out with the content on this page. It took me hours just to insert a black background in the heading and what you see is not even what I was aiming for. I guess I have to go and learn this but it sounds really difficult!ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

            <dd>I have no idea how I got here. It is quite challenging but I can't stop. This <strong>Tech</strong> has to pay, else I am  doomed.</dd>
